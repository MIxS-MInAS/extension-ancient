2024-06-12,GLOBE,James / Antonio,Motahareh Feizabadifarahani ,MimsHostAssociated + Ancient,mims,reference,"Specify which host genome reads aligned to if aligned bam (JFY: except, really, BAMs should not be uploaded this is not raw data so I think this should be skipped)"
2024-06-12,GLOBE,James / Antonio,Motahareh Feizabadifarahani ,MimsHostAssociated + Ancient,mims,mapping_settings,"Specify what alignment settings were used to align reads against genome (JFY: same as above, aligned reads should not be uploaded - should be raw FASTQ with minimimal processing, and compared to e.g. MAGs or Genomes, tehre is no ENA/SRA data repository for BAM files)"
2024-06-12,GLOBE,James / Antonio,Motahareh Feizabadifarahani ,MimsHostAssociated + Ancient,mims,probe_set,"Specify name or ID of probe set used to enrich libraries (JFY: agreed, Q is how to standardise/database)"
2024-06-12,GLOBE,James / Antonio,Yuejiao Huang,MimsHostAssociated + Ancient,mims,processed_data,"Specify whether data uploaded has been processed further than minimum required than ENA (JFY: should not have happened for data upload, maybe a good thing for AncientMetagenomeDir as retroactive info!)"
2024-06-12,GLOBE,James / Antonio,Mikkel Winther Pedersen,MimsSediment+Ancient,mims,strandedness,"Specify the specific strandedness of the eventual DNA library, single or double"
2024-06-12,GLOBE,James / Antonio,Mikkel Winther Pedersen,MimsSediment+Ancient,mims,length_of_storage,Specify the length of storage between sampling or removal from environment and extraction (JFY: we discussed whether this can be simply inferred between the MIMS collection_data and the ancient package extraction date...)
