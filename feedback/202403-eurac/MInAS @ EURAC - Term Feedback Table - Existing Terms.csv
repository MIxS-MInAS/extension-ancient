3/8/2024,Eurac,Mohamed,Stefania/Christina/Alexandra,MIMSHostassociated+Ancient,v0.1.0,ancient,collection_date,You need to specify in the description that you refer to the sampling of the specific sample in the laboratory as soon as the laboratory workflow starts; or if not you should be more specific; e.g. a mummy was recovered in 1960; in 2015 a bone piece was recovered from the mummy to perform aDNA analysis. The sampling of this bone for aDNA analysis was performed in the laboratory in 2019. What should we indicate? 
3/8/2024,Eurac,Mohamed,Stefania/Christina/Alexandra,MIMSHostassociated+Ancient,v0.1.0,ancient,env_broad_scale,Make it optional since very often we do not have this information in aDNA field (eg in museum collections)

3/8/2024,Eurac,Mohamed,Stefania/Christina/Alexandra,MIMSHostassociated+Ancient,v0.1.0,ancient,storage_conditions,More specific options are needed; What is stored? The individual? The sampled bone?  The suggestions à the individual in general; should be better specified in the description; multiple options for 1 sample 
3/8/2024,Eurac,Mohamed,Stefania/Christina/Alexandra,MIMSHostassociated+Ancient,v0.1.0,ancient,recovery_date,"in the description you specify a time stamp, but in most of the excavations there are time ranges "
3/8/2024,Eurac,Mohamed,Stefania/Christina/Alexandra,MIMSHostassociated+Ancient,v0.1.0,ancient,site_type,"for aDNA it would be very interesting; it is not very clear where to put the information where the individual was buried – soil, tomb, cave?  Suggestion à We want to add in the ancient package another term to specify where the individuals was buried; especially to specify if the individual was in contact with soil or not (e.g. wooden/stone coffin etc.) "
3/8/2024,Eurac,Mohamed,Stefania/Christina/Alexandra,MIMSHostassociated+Ancient,v0.1.0,ancient,cultural_era,"The chronology is problematic if you have e.g., 14C data that spans over more than only one chronological timing. Also, the webpage given makes it difficult to select the right cultural era; cultural_era or sample_age should be mandatory; you need to put the option to put NA;"
3/8/2024,Eurac,Mohamed,Stefania/Christina/Alexandra,MIMSHostassociated+Ancient,v0.1.0,ancient,sample_age ,BP is misleading; therefore use BCE and CE; if this is mandatory then sample_age_inference has to be mandatory as well
