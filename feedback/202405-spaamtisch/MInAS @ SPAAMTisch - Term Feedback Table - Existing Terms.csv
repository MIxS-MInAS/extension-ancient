2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Tsunami  Piotr Rozwalak?,AncientSedimentMIMS,v0.1.0,mims,env_broad_scale,You should replace current link with http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000428  in the legend 
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Tsunami  Piotr Rozwalak?,AncientSedimentMIMS,v0.1.0,sediment,temp,"This category is confusing, I don’t know situations where temperature of sediments is measured in field practice. And also might misleading to the temperature of storage"
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Tsunami  Piotr Rozwalak?,AncientSedimentMIMS,v0.1.0,sediment,depth,units could be better standarized
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Tsunami  Piotr Rozwalak?,AncientSedimentMIMS,v0.1.0,ancient,dna_extraction_date,I think this could be optional
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Tsunami  Piotr Rozwalak?,AncientSedimentMIMS,v0.1.0,ancient,experimental_procedures,In the legend: „Provide a DOI to refer to the paper where the procedure is explained in more details” what procedures? Damage treatment?
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Tsunami  Piotr Rozwalak?,AncientSedimentMIMS,v0.1.0,ancient,lib_type,I would like to specify somewhere the name of specific region that was amplified
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Zoe Pochon,AncientHost-associatedMIMS,v0.1.0,mims,samp_name,It would be nice to have a samp_name_alias option here to provide the archaeological ID for example
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Zoe Pochon,AncientHost-associatedMIMS,v0.1.0,mims,samp_taxon_id,What do we do in case of coinfection?
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Zoe Pochon,AncientHost-associatedMIMS,v0.1.0,mims,collection_date,Would need to ask my colleague. Why is it compulsory if we already provide the sequencing date? Or do you mean the excavation date?
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Zoe Pochon,AncientHost-associatedMIMS,v0.1.0,mims,env_broad_scale,"In the legend section of this item, the link for more explanation doesn't work when one clicks on it. I also am not sure on how to find that kind of information because it would require the archaeologists to go back into their excavation files."

2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Zoe Pochon,AncientHost-associatedMIMS,v0.1.0,ancient,dna_extraction_date,Would be nice if we could choose the format of entry for the date because mine are registered in swedish format yy/mm/dd and it didn't work well copy-pasting
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Zoe Pochon,AncientHost-associatedMIMS,v0.1.0,mims,lib_layout,I think this one should be compulsory
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Zoe Pochon,AncientHost-associatedMIMS,v0.1.0,ancient,lib_type,"I find lib_type misleading, would prefer it to be named amplicon, it would be clearer on what is the question"
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Rodrigo Barquera,AncientHost-associatedMIMS,v0.1.0,mims,env_broad_scale,"I would suggest, as req lvl X, original env_broad_scale. In the case of for example, Mexico City, pre-Hispanic era classification is completely different to what it was shortly after conquest, and completely different to what it is now"
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Rodrigo Barquera,AncientHost-associatedMIMS,v0.1.0,ancient,cultural_era,"Maybe add, if available, whether location at recovery matches location of origin (yes/no/unknown), and whether there are diet studies available (yes/no/unknown)"

2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Bianca Bonucci,AncientHost-associatedMIMS,v0.1.0,mims,env_broad_scale,"Descriptions and examples are very ecology-based… it also uses terms like ‘time of sampling’ and ‘where the sample was collected’, which can be tricky in an archaeological and aDNA context. What is collection when it comes to samples?"
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Bianca Bonucci,AncientHost-associatedMIMS,v0.1.0,mims,temp,"Do not have access to the field notes, and even then I’m not sure they were so detailed"

2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Bianca Bonucci,AncientHost-associatedMIMS,v0.1.0,host-associated,samp_store_dur,What about a question if there is residual material from the analysis (boolean – T/F)

2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam","Marica Baldoni, Lena Granehäll",Host-associatedMIGSBacteria + Ancient,v0.1.0,mims,env_broad_scale,(and env_local_scale) important to give more guidances. What about a coffin or crypt? There is no soil around it! Useful because if there is soil: more contamination (Meriam: would site_type work? Not necessarily). Collection date vs recovery date → needs better description or be able to distinguish
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Zoe Pochon,Host-associatedMIGSBacteria + Ancient,v0.1.0,ancient,sample_age,"sample age, why not compulsory?  Maybe a range at least? But Q: if clearly ancient (has damage patterns etc.)"
2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Zoe Pochon,Host-associatedMIGSBacteria + Ancient,v0.1.0,host-associated,host_taxid,"Host-tax ID why is that not mandatory?
Should be made more required → E?
Particularly for pathogens → add to the

2024-05-06,SPAAMTisch,"James, Meriam",Biancamaria Bonucci,Host-associatedMIGSBacteria + Ancient,v0.1.0,mims,env_broad_scale,"broad/local/medium scale → still very confusing  Material in which you did the sampling → sampling in aDNA would be lab? Would it be ‘air’? Sampling has specific meaning in ancient DNA (sort of more would be like burial environment)
What about samples left in a collection for a very long time? What if the original e.g. burial environment information is lost now?
