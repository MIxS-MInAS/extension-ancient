2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Søren Overballe-Petersen,AncientSedimentMIMS,0.1.1,mims,lib_vector,"General inconsistency in labels between clonal libraries (lib_vector) vs sequencing libraryes (e.g. lib_concentration, or lib_reads_seqd), naming should be reconsidered to distinguish"
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Søren Overballe-Petersen,AncientSedimentMIMS,0.1.1,ancient,lib_type,"Should be renamed, it's not really a lib_type but rather the input to library creation (i.e., DNA is already amplified with marker speicifc primers prior construction to sequencing library)"
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Lasse Vinner,AncientSedimentMIMS,0.1.1,ancient,site_type,Unclear what this is exactly compared to the env_medium_scale or env_local_scale terms... (the env_* terms really need more guidance and examples...)
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Abigail Ramsøe,AncientSedimentMIMS,0.1.1,mims,adapter,Unclear what the actual sequencing required is: just the adapter itself (e.g. standard illumina) or plus index sequence too? Just sequences that need to be trimmed? What about barcodes?
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Xihan Chen,AncientSedimentMIMS,0.1.1,ancient,lib_reamplfication_polymerase,"Definition is rather unclear, reamplification at what stage? (JFY: need to specify it's the one that can influence presence of damage)"
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Xihan Chen/Lasse Vinner,AncientSedimentMIMS,0.1.1,ancient,num_reamp_cycles,"Should explicitly state if this is for capture experiments (where it's most relevant), but defintion needs to be more clear -> before or post-capture reamplification? What if there are multiple rounds of capture? Only required if it's capture data; but given can have multiple rounds of amplification cycles at different stages maybe it's not too complicaited and not sufficiently useful enough/relevant for analysis to be worth keeping?"
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Xihan Chen/Lasse Vinner,AncientSedimentMIMS,0.1.1,ancient,lib_concentration,"Very unlikely most labs have a qPCR sufficient (very expensive), for purposes of JFY (contamiantion estimation with decontam), other less recise/semi-quantitive alternatives might be better -> molarity? Another alternative is fragment analyser as then quantification in specific size range (but must ensure same for negative control"
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Lasse Vinner,AncientSedimentMIMS,0.1.1,mims,depth,Not super clear where this refers to when it comes to e.g. a lake; is it useful when don't have water surface depth (new field: water_depth)
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Magnus Johannsen,AncientSedimentMIMS,0.1.1,mims,depth,"Mentions intervals, but format isn't clear how this should be indicated - or might be better to have two other distcrete (depth_from, depth_to)"
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Magnus Johannsen,AncientSedimentMIMS,0.1.1,mims,geo_loc_name,"Maybe should be split into separate fields for country vs region, current system seems inclear due to mixing of ontology and free text"
