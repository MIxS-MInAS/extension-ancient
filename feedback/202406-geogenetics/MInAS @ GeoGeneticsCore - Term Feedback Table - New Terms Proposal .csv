Date,Group,Presenter,Person,Proposed Combination,Proposed Extension,Proposed Term ID,Description
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Lasse Vinner,AncientSedimentMIMS,mims,strandedness,"Have a dedicated field for strandedness of sequencing library, to be more explicit than just lib_preparation_protocol"
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Søren Overballe-Petersen,AncientSedimentMIMS,mims,ext_vol_dna_lib_conts,Should have a 'samp_vol_we_dna_ext' but for input amount of extract into library construction
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Lasse Vinner,AncientSedimentMIMS,ancient,probe_set,"A field for indicating which probe set has been used. (JFY: good candidate for fixed list - implementation is hard, how to standardise?)"
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Søren Overballe-Petersen,AncientSedimentMIMS,mims,extract_concentration,"A field for the DNA concentration after extraction, with separate field for volume (or normalise?); might be complicated: qBIT vs nanodrop will have different precision; also maybe only interested in specific fragment range...)"
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Xihan Chen,AncientSedimentMIMS,mims,dna_insert_size,If people are interested in whether the seuqencing output matches the peak distribution
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Xihan Chen,AncientSedimentMIMS,mims,seq_chemistry_kit,Specific sequencing kit used could be useful to track (JFY: but how to standardise? And that useful for downstream analysis?)
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Magnus Johansen,AncientSedimentMIMS,mims,depth_from,"For a sample taking from e.g. a core that has different depth sections, or if the smapling depth wasn't consistent when sampling water, provide the upper (highest) bound of the sampling internval. Can be used in combination the existing 'depth' term which provides the discreete point depth"
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Magnus Johansen,AncientSedimentMIMS,mims,depth_to,"For a sample taking from e.g. a core that has different depth sections, or if the smapling depth wasn't consistent, provide the lower (deepest) bound of the sampling internval. Can be used in combination the existing 'depth' term which provides the discreete point depth"
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Xihan Chen,AncientSedimentMIMS,mims,site_name,Could consider having the explicit site or station name where it doesn't fit with the geo_loc_name
2024-06-11,GeoGenetics,James/Antonio,Xihan Chen,AncientSedimentMIMS,mims,size_selection,Whether a library/extract has been 'fragment size selected' prior sequencing
