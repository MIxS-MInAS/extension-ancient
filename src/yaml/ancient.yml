  This file contains a YAML-formatted specification of the Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS) standard, generated using LinkML (https://linkml.io/linkml/). This file is released by the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC; https://www.gensc.org/) for use by anyone handling data or information about biological sequences. This file is also used as an authoritative 'source of truth' to generate downstream GSC artifacts, available here: https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/tree/main/project

      A collection of terms appropriate when collecting samples and sequencing samples 
      of data containing ancient DNA, i.e., degraded molecules not from living organisms.
    comments:
      - This extension that is intended to be used in very specific cases but almost always in conjunction with other MIxS checklists and extensions.
        It does not therefore (currently) include additional common terms from checklists.
